You had to run for the weekend,
And you had nowhere to be.
You had enough of the sorrow,
And it was all on TV.
You blew a kiss to a goodbye and,
That's how you met me.
Back to New York in the morning,
You were right where we should be.

As you said here I am, here I am.
What I got is yours .
Tomorrow I might be gone,
But tonight, it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.

Well I know I barely know you.
Is that the way it should start?
Said go ahead take a cheap shot,
We took a shot in the dark.

We put our cards on the table and said,
Forget about the rest.
I'll drive you off in the morning,
Tonight is ours.

You said, here I am, here I am.
What I got is yours.
Tomorrow I might be gone,
But tonight it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.

You said here I am, here I am.
What I got is yours.
Tomorrow I will be gone,
But tonight it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
Oh it's ours.
